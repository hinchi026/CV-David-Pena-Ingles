    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As a security consultant (Chief Information Security Officer, CISO), I have acquired extensive 
      knowledge and experience in planning, coordinating, and managing information security processes 
      in various organizations. My focus is on defining risk analysis methodologies and creating business 
      continuity plans, validating all processes with the resilience an organization needs to face market 
      challenges.

      I am a highly committed person, with great adaptability and availability to travel and/or relocate if
      necessary to perform my job with excellence. I have skills to make strategic, tactical, and operational 
      decisions in information security, allowing me to act relevantly up to both tactical and operational 
      levels in ICT.

      My experience in installing, designing, and managing Network Security Infrastructure is broad,
      focusing on Firewall management, VPNs, IDS/IPS, vulnerability analysis, Pen-Testing, monitoring,
      network performance analysis, business continuity, computer security training plans, external and
      internal auditing, evidence acquisition (Forensic Analysis). I also possess exceptional communication 
      skills, am self-taught, and have the ability to quickly learn how to handle new technologies.

      I am able to work in a team or independently and have experience in managing interdisciplinary
      groups. In addition, I have expertise in tools such as Juniper Network, Radware, Fortinet, Palo Alto, 
      Infoblox, Aruba Network, Pulse Secure, Azure security, Nessus, NMAP, Kali Linux, among others. I 
      am confident that my experience, skills, and knowledge can positively contribute to any organization 
      that needs an information security expert.
